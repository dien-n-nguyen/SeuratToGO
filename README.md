# SeuratToGO

## Description
The package processes Seurat's differential expression markers (after running FindAllMarkers() function in Seurat). This package reformats the to go through GO analysis using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery). It also provides functions for analysis of DAVID output files. Currently, users have to manually separate the clusters in Seurat's markers dataframe using Excel and export it as a tab-delimited text file to upload to DAVID. They then have to manually combine all the DAVID output files (one for each clusters) to do further analysis. The R package includes the main components: DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, man subdirectory and R subdirectory. Additionally, LICENSE, README and subdirectories vignettes, tests, data and inst are also explored.
The `SeuratToGO` package was developed using `R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16 ucrt)`, `Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)` and `Running under: Windows 11 x64 (build 22621)`.
## Installation

You can install the development version of SeuratToGO from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dien-n-nguyen/SeuratToGO")
library("SeuratToGO")
```
## Overview

``` r
ls("package:SeuratToGO")
data(package = "SeuratToGO") 
browseVignettes("SeuratToGO")
```
`SeuratToGO` contains 5 functions.

1.  ***separate_clusters*** for separating the differentially expressed markers data frame generated by Seurat and exporting it as a tab-delimited text file.

2.  ***combine_david_files*** for combining all the DAVID output files into a list of data frames.

3.  ***get_top_processes*** to get the top processes for a specific cluster.

4.  ***get_all_top_processes*** to get the top processes for every cluster and consolidate them into one data frame

5.  ***top_processes_heatmap*** to generate a heatmap for all the top processes in each cluster

The package also contains a dataset called `pbmc_markers`, which contains differentially expressed markers generated using Seurat's tutorial. It also contains a zip folder called `david.zip` in `inst/extdata/` that contains example DAVID output files for users to use when following the vignette.


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(SeuratToGO)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
