First, you need to load the package before using any of its functions.
```{r setup}
library(SeuratToGO)
```

pbmc_markers is a data frame that contains the genes identified in each cluster
and other associated values. It is produced by the FindAllMarkers() function in
the Seurat package. You can do generate this data by yourself by following the
tutorial on: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html.
```{r}
separate_clusters(pbmc_markers)
```
